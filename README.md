*In the everyday life of a teacher at the Granite School District, meetings are important. Some go one a week, some go more. **Carbon** adds a feature that these meetings never had before: Efficient documentation.*

## Mission

Carbon is a simple program in concept, but hard to implement. The project contains several key features important to the function of the program. It can document meetings efficiently; with different groups of teachers.Carbon also hasposts toallow on topic discussion of specific topics with document attachment. Alongside these functions, Carbon also gives users different permissions, to help administrators manage teachers or other users that could create problems if left unmanaged.

With our project, teachers can more effectively communicate with other teachers and share learning material, which allows them to more effectively teach their students.

Carbon introduces the following features:

* Record meetings with all information and documents that need to be saved

* Fast, efficient, and clean interface

* Simple to use, yet still powerful

* Searching features with sorting to allow quick locating of what a user needs.

This project is made by the Carbon Team: [Stefan Todorov](https://github.com/coravacav) and me. We brought this project to the Technology Student Association, and we won the first place in the software development event of the Utah-state competition.
